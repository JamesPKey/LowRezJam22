# LowRezJam22

_Escape_ is a game created for [LOWREZJAM 2022](https://itch.io/jam/lowrezjam-2022). The aim for this jam, was to create a game limited to 64x64 pixels.   
   
This is an escape room style game, where the player wakes up in an unknown house, and much attempt to leave.
   
It is powered by [Phaser3](https://phaser.io/phaser3) and written in Typescript, utilising Vite, and Rollup.  
All art (or lack thereof ðŸ˜…) minus the `Phaser` logo, and all sound assets are original.

[Play it on Itch.io](https://jameskey.itch.io/escape)
